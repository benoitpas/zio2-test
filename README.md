Simple ZIO program to check if I could use ZIO for the advent of code 2024.

To checked that I solved [Day 1 of Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1).

Only using ZIO to encapsule the use of the File resource is not really worth it in the context of the advent of code. I would need to try other parts of ZIO like [StateManagement](https://zio.dev/reference/state-management/) or [Streaming](https://zio.dev/reference/stream/) to really justify using it.
